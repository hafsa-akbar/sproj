# Daam pe Kaam

**Daam pe Kaam** ('Work at a Price') is a web application designed to bridge the market asymmetry between blue-collar
workers (househelp, drivers, gardeners, etc.) and potential employers.
The platform offers a free service that enhances visibility and employment opportunities for workers, while enabling
employers to find labor beyond traditional word-of-mouth recommendations currently in-place in Pakistan.

### Features

- **One-shot Jobs**: Hire workers for short-term tasks like cleaning, cooking, or gardening, with payments made on an
  hourly basis.
- **Permanent Hire**: Secure long-term employees for ongoing household or business needs.
- **Worker Profiles**: Browse detailed profiles, read employer reviews, and filter workers based on skills and
  availability.
- **Recommendation System**: Verified employers can leave ratings and reviews on the workers that have worked with
  them in the past.
- **Couple Posting**: Pair up with another user on the platform to post jobs as a 'couple'.
- **Direct Communication**: Connecting employers with the workers they are interested in via WhatsApp.

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Svelte – for creating a responsive and user-friendly interface.
